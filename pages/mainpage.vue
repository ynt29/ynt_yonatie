            <p class="mb-2">I’m a Junior Frontend Developer 
                from Bangkok, Thailand, with a passionate interest in the world of data analytics.
            </p>
            <p class=" mb-2">My experience in frontend development has equipped me with creating user-friendly interfaces, 
                the result of user-oriented analytics and attention to detail. 
                <br/>
                I intend to use my coding skills and problem-solving abilities to 
                extract and transform meaningful insights from datasets into actionable plans.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Outside of work, 
                I’ve utilized data analytics skills such as spreadsheets and data visualization for personal financial planning. 
                This includes tracking transactions, categorizing spending and finding important expense insights to identify expense category for potential cutbacks.
                <br />
                Data-Driven Decision Making has helped me plan spending precisely and align it with real-life needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that determination for learning new things 
                and adapting to new challenges are traits that have shaped me into who I am today. 
                <br/>
                I graduated from Political Science at Ramkhamhaeng University in 2020, which has nothing to do with programming at all. 
                However, my commitment to learning unfamiliar things like frontend development and not giving up even when it’s difficult has led to success 
                in embarking on this journey. and I confident that these qualities will enable me to excel in the field of data analytics.
